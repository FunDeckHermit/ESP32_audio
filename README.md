# ESP32_audio
 First ESP and STM32 pcb project, it will have a power meter sd card wifi and the ability to play back MP3 file (and maybe more).
  Also it will feature a power usage meter. Maybe it will aso have battery power option, i am considering Li-Po and LiFePO4 ,
   i will decide based on the BMS I find vailable.
